# magiscript
A visual front end for a limited python interepreter for linux and windows in a form similar to Labview or the Automate app. pre alpha implementation should include basic selection menus, flowchart connectors, and support for variables and "if" statements.

Additional Alpha features include file and network IO, importing librarys, and time and date event calls.

Possibly with a game as a tutorial to follow.
